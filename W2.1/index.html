        <h2>Online CV</h2>
        <p>This website itself is a web development project I undertook
            as it showcases my web development skills. The website will be improved upon as I learn new things. It is currently
            written in html and CSS but I plan to add JavaScript once I start learning it. The source code for the website can
            be found <a href= "https://github.com/mor94n/online-CV"><b> here. </b></a> </p>

        <h2>Text Based RPG</h2>
        <p>My first programming project was a text based rpg game called escape alcatraz. I worked on this project as part of a team with one other person. The game was made using Python. To download and play the game, please click <a href= "https://q1h1.itch.io/survive-alcatraz"><b> here. </b></a>
